# Relax: known gaps

Open bugs with a minimal repro, ready for a contributor to take. Each one names what rustc does,
what Relax does, and where to start. Fix one, add its repro as a test (see CONTRIBUTING.md), and
delete its entry here in the same PR.

Every repro is a standalone cargo package (`[workspace]` in its Cargo.toml). Compare
`cargo run --release` with `relax run --quiet <package>` from the package directory.

## 1. Derive and bang macros resolve by bare name across the whole graph

Workspace with four members:

- `a_mac` and `b_mac`: proc-macro crates, each exporting `#[proc_macro_derive(Who)]`, which emits
  `impl <Name> { pub fn who() -> &'static str { "a" } }` (`"b"` in `b_mac`).
- `lib_b`: depends on `b_mac`, `#[derive(b_mac::Who)] pub struct InB;`.
- `app`: depends on `a_mac` and `lib_b`, `use a_mac::Who; #[derive(Who)] struct InApp;`, prints
  `InApp::who()` and `lib_b::InB::who()`.

- rustc: `app=a b=b`.
- Relax: `app=a b=a`. `lib_b`'s derive, written with the full path `b_mac::Who`, expands
  `a_mac`'s macro.

The registry (libs/relax/front/src/macro_reg.rs, `derives` / `macros`) is keyed by the macro's
bare name and the first registered entry wins silently. Real collisions: `stable` (instability and
rustversion), `Error` (thiserror and derive_more). Attribute macros already require the macro
crate in the invoking crate's dependency closure (`attr_macro_at`). Derives and bang macros need
rustc's rule: resolve the path at the invocation (the `use` that brought it in, or the crate the
path names) among the crates the invoking crate depends on.

## 2. `type Error = std::fmt::Error;` in a `serde::Serializer` impl: E0277 (not reproduced)

Seen in a large graph (PR #1326): "E0277: item `Error` has an incompatible type for trait" on a
`Serializer` impl with `type Error = std::fmt::Error;`. rustc accepts it (serde has
`impl ser::Error for fmt::Error`). A standalone serde 1.0.229 package with such a `Serializer`
(spelled `std::fmt::Error`, or `fmt::Error` after `use std::fmt;`) type-checks and runs under Relax
with rustc's output. A repro must find the shape that fails: the impl inside a dependency crate,
`serde_core` without the `std` feature, or a facade re-export.

## 3. One check run spun at full CPU for five minutes (not reproduced)

Seen once (PR #1326) on a serde + `instability` graph: a check spun for five minutes and finished
in 1.4 s on every repeat. If you see it, attach to the live process (`relax inspect <pid>
why-hung`) before it ends; a stack beats a repeat.

## 4. Late lints still print when the check has an error

```rust
#![allow(dead_code)]
fn BadName() {}
struct lower_struct;
fn bad() -> u32 { "no" }
fn main() {}
```

- rustc: E0308 and the `lower_struct` warning (non_camel_case_types is an early lint). No
  `BadName` warning: rustc_interface passes.rs `analysis` stops at an error of the required analyses
  (lint errors excluded) before `misc_checking_3`, so the late lint pass (rustc_lint::check_crate)
  never runs.
- Relax: E0308 and both warnings (non_snake_case is reported too).

dead_code, unnameable_types and unfulfilled_lint_expectations already follow that rule
(compiler/src/check.rs `analyses_ok`, GitHub #1328). The late lints of types/src/lint_late*.rs are
emitted while the bodies are checked, so they need to be held back (or dropped) once an error is
known. Start with a "late" mark on the lints rustc runs in LateLintPass.

## 5. `let mut x` assigned but never used: Relax reports at `x`, rustc at `mut x`

```rust
struct WriteOnly { w: u32 }
fn make_wo() -> u32 { let mut x = WriteOnly { w: 1 }; x.w = 2; 0 }
fn main() { make_wo(); }
```

- rustc: `2:27: warning: variable `x` is assigned to, but never used` (the span starts at `mut`).
- Relax: the same warning at 2:31.

Start in types/src/lint_liveness.rs (the span of the binding it reports).

## 6. A constant the trait solver evaluates keeps the solver's typing mode (no repro known)

rustc's `try_evaluate_const` (traits/mod.rs) evaluates in the post-analysis environment whatever
the solver's mode; Relax's `evaluate_const` (types/src/next_solver/goals.rs) passes the solver's
own mode (Coherence in the overlap check) for every constant but a repeat count.

## 7. A provided crate's `std::env` does not see its program's run-env values

A package's `[package.metadata.relax.run-env]` values are read only by the program: its JIT-run
code, and platform code reading a setting that only tunes or reports that program's own run. They
never reach a reader that decides what the process loads, executes or opens, what the person's
invocation decided, or what the loader hands the next image (base/src/progenv.rs `set_run_env`).

A provided crate (built by rustc into the loader, such as Makepad's platform crates) has two
reads. `relax_api::env::var` / `var_os` is the program's environment: under the loader progenv's
program view (`program_var_os`: the program's values, then the process environment), without
one `std::env`. `std::env` is the loader process's. Makepad's HAL reads its logs, traces,
profilers, tuning settings and test hooks through the first; its backend, devices, paths,
drivers, window visibility and focus, app identity, session facts and handovers through the
second.

- cargo: no run-env (Relax's own table); every crate of the program reads one environment.
- Relax: `relax_api::env::var("APP_MODE")` gives the run-env's value in JIT-run code and in a
  provided crate's rustc code; `std::env::var("APP_MODE")` gives it in JIT-run code and
  `NotPresent` in a provided crate's rustc code (tools/run/fixture/modules_harness.rs
  `a_packages_run_env_is_its_programs_and_grants_nothing`).

What stays out of reach:
- A C library in the process (the Vulkan loader, libva, GStreamer) and a third-party dependency of
  a provided crate read libc's environment, so run-env values never reach them. That is the
  protection: a value that names a library or a path stays the person's.
- HAL source that JIT-run code reaches compiles from source, where `std::env` is the program's
  environment: the app's event loop calls `OpenReq::from_env`, so a run-env's
  `MAKEPAD_HAL_BACKEND` or `MAKEPAD_HIDE_WINDOWS` picks how the app's own window opens, as the
  program's own `set_var` does (under cargo too). It grants nothing the program could not ask for
  itself; the host's window, devices and paths are read by the host's code.
- A run from the stores (`makepad run <git url>`, runner/src/lib.rs `run_spec`) starts the host
  before it has the package's manifest, so a setting the host reads once at its start (the HAL's
  log switch, `MAKEPAD_GPU_PROF`) is read before the run-env is applied. A run from a checkout
  applies the run-env first.

Start in libs/relax_api/src/lib.rs (`env`) for the read, and in tools/run/runner/src/lib.rs
`run_spec` for a store run's order.

## 8. A boxed slice or str in an allocator of its own has no Vec or String conversions yet

```rust
use std::alloc::System;

fn main() {
    let b: Box<[u8], System> = Box::new_in([1u8, 2, 3], System);
    let c = b.clone();
    let v = b.into_vec();
    let n: u32 = c.into_iter().map(u32::from).sum();
    println!("{} {}", v.len(), n);
}
```

- rustc 1.100: `3 6`. Clone, `into_vec` and IntoIterator of `Box<[T], A>` go through `Vec<T, A>`.
- Relax: E0599 / E0277. Box has its allocator parameter, but Vec does not yet (relax issue 156 ports
  them in that order), so these impls and the `Box<str, A>` ones are the global allocator's only.

Start in libs/relax/compiler/std/core/boxed.rs (its `Box<[T]>` and `Box<str>` impls) and vec/mod.rs.

## 9. A confined build script reaches files, folders, its environment, pipes and `$RUSTC` only

Under `makepad run` (compile-time policy Sandboxed), the build script of a package whose units
hold a registry or git package runs confined (compiler/src/sandbox/script.rs): its program runs in
an arena, and the only host functions it reaches are the domain's entries. It reads its package's
source (a registry package's folder, a git package's repository in the store, a path package's
workspace) and OUT_DIR, writes OUT_DIR, reads the environment its parent gave it, and asks
`$RUSTC` option-led questions, answered in the host. Bare `relax` runs every script as cargo does.

```rust
// build.rs of a registry package
fn main() {
    let t = std::time::SystemTime::now();
    println!("cargo:rustc-env=BUILT_AT={:?}", t);
}
```

- cargo: the script runs with the person's rights.
- Relax under `makepad run`: the script fails, naming the C function its code reached
  (`clock_gettime`).

Not served yet, each a refusal naming its C function unless said otherwise:
- Windows: there are no arena windows yet; such a script is refused there with that reason.
- threads, clocks, sockets and name lookups, and any C function a script declares itself.
- `symlink`, hard links, `chown`, and setting file times.
- `$CARGO` questions, and programs other than `$RUSTC`: refused as not found (NotFound).
- A folder of the store opened as a `File`: an error.
- A store package is read as committed: the run's edits (RELAX_EDITS) do not reach a confined
  script.
- A git package checked out on disk by cargo reads its own folder, not its whole repository.

Its output lines act in the run with the person's rights, so they are held to what the script
reaches (relax-front unitgraph.rs `confined_output_refusals`); a line past that fails the build,
naming it, and none of that output is kept: `rustc-link-search` and `rerun-if-changed` paths lie
in its folders (a `rerun-if-changed` folder is walked without following links); `rustc-link-lib`
names a plain library of a kind the run loads, never found in the working folder; no
`rustc-link-arg` of any form; `rustc-env` sets no name that steers the run's process or its tools
(`script_env_refused`: the program's variables only); no `cargo::` instruction cargo does not
know.

Start in compiler/src/sandbox/script.rs (`entry`, the domain's table) and sandbox/broker.rs (the
folders and the walk); the decision is relax-front unitgraph.rs `script_confined`.
